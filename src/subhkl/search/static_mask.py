"""Static-structure masks: what the detector always sees is not a peak.

Beam-stop shadows, illumination boundaries and instrument-body glow are fixed
in the detector frame, while a Bragg reflection survives at most a frame or
two of sample rotation.  A per-bank low quantile across enough frames
(exposure-normalised) therefore contains the artifacts and none of the crystal -- the frames do not even have
to come from the same sample, only from the same instrument configuration,
which makes the mask an instrument calibration product rather than a
per-dataset one.

Two artifact classes, measured on CG4D l1-mbl (both recurring across ten
runs while every Bragg peak moved):

* an illumination boundary -- the static background fell 2.2 -> 0.6 counts
  over ~25 columns, a gradient 8x the panel's typical column-to-column
  variation.  The smooth background model cannot follow a step, so the
  residual ridge along it is tiled with false atoms.  The boundary sat
  ~190 px inside the panel, out of reach of any border erosion.
* a diffuse static glow at ~2x the ambient rate, carrying dozens of weak
  spurious detections whose positions jitter from run to run -- invisible
  to any peak-level recurrence veto, caught only by a pixel mask.

The mask marks static structure on a *band-pass* of the static map --
scales between the atom footprint and the background window -- because that
is precisely the structure the background model cannot follow and the finder
mistakes for peaks.  A wide smooth halo passes: the background follows it,
and the genuine reflections sitting on it must stay findable.  Steps are
caught by the band-pass gradient, textured glow by the band-pass level, and
the union is dilated so atoms merely touching structure are covered.

The file format is a reduced single-frame stack: ``images`` [n_banks, H, W]
(uint8, 1 = valid, 0 = masked) with ``bank_ids`` alongside, so every tool
that reads reduced files can display a mask, and the finder maps mask frames
onto its input by physical bank rather than by position in the file.

    Two robustness properties are load-bearing:

    * Frames are normalised to unit mean rate before stacking, so the same
      static feature at a different exposure (or beam current) produces the
      same mask, and frames of mixed exposures may be pooled.  Both criteria
      below are then ratios on a relative rate map rather than counts.
    * The static map is a *low quantile* across frames (default p25), not
      the median.  A dense diffraction pattern puts some reflection near a
      given pixel in half the frames, which pollutes a median built from a
      handful of runs -- measured on l1-mbl forward banks, where the median
      map's gradients masked genuine Bragg peaks.  A static feature is
      present in *every* frame, so it survives any quantile; a reflection
      would have to sit still through >75% of the scan to leak in.

    ``grad_nmads`` is the boundary criterion: pixels where the static map's
    gradient magnitude exceeds this many MADs of the panel-wide gradient are
    structure, not statistics (the l1-mbl illumination edge measures ~8 MADs
    of margin even at threshold 8).  ``texture_factor`` is the band-pass level
    criterion, relative to the panel's ambient rate; ``wide_sigma`` sets the
    long end of the *level* band (the glow-texture scale); ``edge_sigma``
    sets the long end of the *contrast* band -- the scale the finder's own
    background model can actually follow (its window is max(15,
    5 * max_sigma) px).  They differ because their failure modes differ: a
    longer level band lets plateaus inflate the MAD floor and re-admits
    dense-diffraction texture, while a shorter contrast band opens a blind
    gap -- the l1-mbl backward-panel illumination boundaries (10-90% widths
    ~40 px) vanished from a 10 px band yet still produced false atoms,
    because the finder could not follow them either; their capture
    saturates at 25.  ``dilate_px`` should cover an atom
    footprint (~2 * max_sigma) so that an atom whose tail rests on the
    structure is masked along with it.

    """Per physical bank: certified peaks of a finder run on summed frames.

    Per-frame certification cannot see what the mask sees: the static map
    pools ~n frames of evidence, so a quasi-static reflection just below
    every single frame's admission level is masked with no route to
    exoneration.  A finder run on the per-bank *sum* (see
    ``build_summed_file``) closes the asymmetry -- deviance is additive, so
    the same peak compounds ~n-fold there -- and its certified detections
    are exonerated in every frame of their bank.  The amplitude recorded
    here is the pooled one; the caller rescales by the bank's frame count
    to recover the per-frame amplitude (exact for a static feature, an
    overestimate only for moving peaks, which the quantile never masks and
    which therefore cost nothing to over-protect).

    The evidence bar is the same as per-frame -- pooling the evidence is the
    point -- but the *shape* bar must transfer.  Residual deviance per DoF
    is one for a correct model regardless of counts, while its mismatch
    component grows linearly with them: E[res/DoF] ~ 1 + eps^2 * counts.
    Summing n frames multiplies the counts by n, so a bright genuine peak
    whose per-frame residual is a comfortable 1.1 blows past a fixed bar of
    2 on the pooled fit -- goodness of fit gets *stricter* with statistics,
    and the pooled bootstrap was stripping exactly the strong reflections
    it was meant to keep.  The bar therefore scales as
    1 + (residual_max - 1) * n_bank, which preserves the discrimination:
    an artifact's per-frame ~3.5 scales to ~1 + 2.5 n, far above it.

    The bank comes from the finder's own per-peak ``bank`` dataset, so the
