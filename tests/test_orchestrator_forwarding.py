"""The orchestrator is the only place the CLI's finder options become a finder.

Every unit test that exercises an option builds MatrixFreeSparseRBFPeakFinder
directly, so an option the orchestrator drops stays green in all of them while
being dead on every command line.  That is exactly what happened: the class
defaults are sensible and the constructor ends in **kwargs, so nothing crashed
when --sparse-rbf-profile-file gaussian (the documented opt-out of the learned
atom family) and --sparse-rbf-chunk-size (the documented memory knob) were
silently ignored.  This test goes through prepare_harvest_tasks, the path the
CLI takes.
